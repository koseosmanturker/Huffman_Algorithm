#### What is Huffman Algorithm
Huffman algorithm is a method that determines variable-length(Prefix Code: A code is called a prefix (free) code if no codeword is a prefix of another one)  bit-codes to characters, such that the lengths of the codes depend on the frequencies of the characters in a typical text. Once variable-length prefix-free codes are determined, given text can be encoded. Messages take less space (compared to fixed-length encoding) since the letters that appear more frequently are assigned shorter codes. 

This is performed by first building a Huffman coding tree based on a given set of frequencies. From the tree, bit-codes for each character are determined and then used to encode a text. 
The tree is also used to decode an encoded message. It provides a way to determine which bit sequences translate back to a character.
